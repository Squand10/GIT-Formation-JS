            <h3>Scientists have found evidence of a huge blast of radiation from the Sun that hit Earth more than 2,000 years ago. </h3>

            alt="Large solar proton events could potentially threaten satellites, such as those that provide GPS services" />
            <p> The result has important implications for the present, because solar storms can disrupt modern technology.</p>
            <p> The team found evidence in Greenland ice cores that the Earth was bombarded with solar proton particles in 660BC.</p>
            <p>The event was about 10 times more powerful than any since modern instrumental records began.</p>
            <p>The Sun periodically releases huge blasts of charged particles and other radiation that can travel towards Earth.</p>
            <p>The particular kind of solar emission recorded in the Greenland ice is known as a solar proton event (SPE). In the modern era, when these high-energy particles collide with Earth, they can knock out electronics in satellites we rely on for communications and services such as GPS.</p>
            <p>The radiation may also pose a health risk for astronauts. And passengers and crew on commercial aircraft that fly at high altitudes and close to the poles, such as on transatlantic routes, could receive increased radiation doses - though this depends on many variables.</p>
            <p>Other types of solar radiation events can trigger aurorae in the high atmosphere and shut down electrical grids.</p>
